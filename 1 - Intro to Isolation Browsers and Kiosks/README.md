# Introduction to Isolation Browsers and Kiosks

## What is an Isolation Browser

An isolation browser is a locked down browser, setup to protect against various types of attacks including: 
 - MitB / browser based attacks
 - Malicous download / introduction of payloads
 - Data egress and DLP (in some cases)
 - They can be used to protect users browsing or as part of a kiosk/lockdown configuration

## Constraints of Kiosk Modes for Introduction of Payloads

For a detailed analysis of kiosks, see our [CTRL+ESC+HOST](https://github.com/CroodSolutions/CTRL-ESC-HOST/tree/main) project.

For kiosk hacking in general though, sometimes kiosk modes will contain download restrictions or may be used with an isolation browser, to further reduce the risk of kiosk escape or attacks on adjacent resources.  

## Legal and Ethical Notice

Only test on your own isolation browser instances or kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate industry ethics and best practices, such as within the scope of a penetration test or bug bounty program.
