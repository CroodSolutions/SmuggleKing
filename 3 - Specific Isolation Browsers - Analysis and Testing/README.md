# Analysis of Specific Isolation Browser Products

## Placeholder: Stay Tuned

Addition of findings to this section will be delayed significantly, while we work with specific security vendors and report flaws. Eventually, you can expect an overview of specific findings (possibly mapped to CVEs), as well as positive mention of any isolation browsers we were not able to effectively attack.

## Legal and Ethical Notice

Only test on your own isolation browser instances or kiosks and/or with proper written permission and following all appropriate industry ethics and best practices, such as within the scope of a penetration test or bug bounty program.
